# Alpaca.js vs JavaScript Forms

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comparison between Alpaca.js and traditional JavaScript-based forms. The goal is to highlight the ease of use, validation capabilities, and overall simplicity of Alpaca.js when handling complex forms compared to manually implementing form validation and logic in JavaScript.

## Features
### Alpaca.js Form:
- Uses a schema-based approach to define form structure.
- Provides built-in validation with minimal configuration.
- Supports dependent fields and complex data types easily.
- Less code required compared to traditional JavaScript.
- Easily customizable options for fields and form layout.

### JavaScript Form:
- Requires manual handling of input validation.
- Error messages need to be explicitly managed.
- Dynamic field dependencies must be coded manually.
- More complex and error-prone than Alpaca.js.
- Requires event listeners and additional JavaScript logic for submission handling.

## Comparison Table
| Feature              | Alpaca.js | Traditional JavaScript |
|----------------------|----------|------------------------|
| Ease of Use         | ✅ Minimal coding | ❌ Requires manual setup |
| Validation          | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Custom logic required |
| Complex Forms       | ✅ Schema-based | ❌ Requires event listeners |
| Customization      | ✅ Easily configurable | ❌ Requires extra JavaScript & CSS |
| Code Complexity     | ✅ Low | ❌ High due to imperative coding |

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. The page will display two forms: one using Alpaca.js and another built with traditional JavaScript.
4. Fill in both forms to see validation and submission differences.

## Technologies Used
- **Alpaca.js** (for schema-based form handling)
- **JavaScript** (for traditional form handling)
- **Bootstrap** (for styling)
- **jQuery** (for Alpaca.js dependency)

## Conclusion
This project clearly demonstrates that Alpaca.js significantly simplifies form handling, validation, and dynamic field dependencies compared to manually implementing the same in JavaScript. If you are working with complex forms, Alpaca.js is a highly recommended solution for reducing development effort and maintaining cleaner code.
